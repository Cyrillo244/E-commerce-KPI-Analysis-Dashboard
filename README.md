### 1. Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing sales data from a global skincare and beauty e-commerce store. The main goal is to develop a dynamic Power BI dashboard that offers insights into customer behavior, market trends, product performance, and overall business profitability.

Key business goals include:

- Achieving an average annual profit margin of 15% across all product groups

- Driving 20% annual overall sales growth, with a 30% growth target for the corporate segment

- Generating at least $400K in annual sales per market

The dashboard highlights KPIs and visual insights that help evaluate progress towards these targets.

### 2. Data Source & Collection
- Data was sourced from the [FP20 Analytics](https://fp20analytics.com/datasets/) platform, specifically from Challenge 19.
- The dataset contains sales records including order dates, product categories, customer segments, and financial metrics.

### 3. Data Cleaning & Prep
All data preparation and transformation were performed in Power BI's Power Query Editor:

- Extracted Year and Month columns from the "Order Date" field for time-based analysis

- Calculated a Profit Margin column

- Created a custom column to identify repeat customer orders for customer loyalty analysis

- Removed or corrected missing and inconsistent data entries

- Renamed columns for clarity and standardization

### 4. Analytics & Modeling
Key measures and KPIs were developed using DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) in Power BI:

- % Profit Margin: Indicates how much profit is earned per dollar of revenue

- % Repeat Customers: Measures customer retention and loyalty

- % of Sales by Customer: Highlights how much individual customers or customer segments contribute to total revenue

- Visual and interactive elements reveal performance across product categories, customer segments, markets, and time periods

 2. Open the .pbix file included in this project repository (E-commerce KPI analysis Dashboard.pbix).
 3. Use the slicers and filters provided (such as the Year Filter at the top) to dynamically explore data insights across different timeframes and segments.
### 7. Key Findings & Recommendations
- The total sales across the three years are 7 million
- The total profit is 1 million
- The (%) percentage profit margin is 16.35%
- The % percentage of repeat customers is 65.17% meaning more than half of the customers return to shop again after their first purchase
- The profit by segment shows that people who work cooperatively generate the most profit
- The top 10 best-selling products generate 4.83% of the % total sales, meaning the total sales of 7 million is spread across the numerous products of the global store
- Summary of high-level business insights
- Any quantitative conclusions

### 8. Limitations & Next Steps
- This data from FP20 analytics is well structured and very easy to use amd did not require a lot of cleaning. 
- Just a few of the columns had to be renamed 
- Data quality considerations
- Suggested enhancements
